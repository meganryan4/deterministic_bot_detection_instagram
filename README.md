Deterministic Bot Detection and Analysis for Instagram Accounts


This utilises the Instagram Graph API and as such you must have a Meta Developer account.
You must make a Web App on this account and then generate the access token for your Instagram account - requiring a sign-in. 
In defines.py replace 'APP-CLIENT-ID' with the client ID and 'APP-CLIENT-SECRET' with the client secret for the Web App made on this account.

Run the main.py program and the bot detection and analysis begins.


This program determines the likelihood of each of the image posts on the account being AI/sythetically generated.
It dteremines whether any image posts can be foung using Google's reverse image search.
It then uses all of this information to give the account a bot likelihood score, listing the reasons how this score was determined.
